Planning Document // todo 
---------------------------------------

There is a scoring system. Details later. 

There is an HP mechanic instead of lives.
	Slower and bigger bullets deal more damage. Use a formula to calculate this.
	Blue items are not score, they are HP up. They give very small health.
	Blue items overheal when health is at maximum.
		Based on this, it should be implied that max HP =/= initial HP.
		I propose max HP should be acheieved by around stage 2.5~3.
		Diminishing returns are in effect. It should get really bad around 25-33%.
		Theoretical/realistic maximum achievable in a normal run should cap a bit under 50%.
	Pickup density is similar to TH modern era 2. 
	The life pickups are not called life. 

Power caps at 4.0.
	At each 0.2, you get a baby shot familiar with 1/5 effectiveness. 

The difficulty is a tree.
	Higher risk, higher reward. This means in terms of score/life pickups. 
	There are different final bosses. If you pick the easiest path, the game ends early & laughs at you. 
	At the end of stage 3, your difficulty descision is finalized and you proceed on the specific path to your difficulty. 
	We will determine the specifics on stage variants/choices later. 
	(Potential descision for stage 1: Bad dudes are invading -- do you respond right away (ez) or sleep in (hard))		

We don't know how bombs will work yet. Perhaps a charge bar in which you can take dmg/capture spellcards/finish
boss phases.
